# ðŸŽ® SwiftGameCLI

A lightweight terminal game engine written in Swift. This package provides a simple API for handling real-time key input, terminal rendering, and game loopsâ€”all using raw terminal access with ANSI escape sequences.

Ideal for developers looking to create command-line games or interactive terminal-based applications in Swift.

### ðŸ“Œ Using Swift Package Manager

You can add **SwiftGameCLI** to your project by declaring it in your `Package.swift` file:

```swift
// swift-tools-version: 5.9
import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    name: "YourProject",
    platforms: [.macOS(.v11)],
    dependencies: [
        .package(url: "https://github.com/dsadriel/SwiftGameCLI.git", branch: "main")
    ],
    targets: [
        .target(
            name: "YourProject",
            dependencies: ["SwiftGameCLI"]
        )
    ]
)
```

Then, in your Swift source files:

```swift
import SwiftGameCLI
```
